```{r}
# create a blackout mask: get the difference in lighting
#Subtract the night lights intensity after the storm from the night lights intensity before the storm to get the difference in night lights intensity caused (presumably) by the storm.

# The immediately following code line (subtracting after from before) is my first attempt at subtraction, but apparently the variables need to be flipped. My initial approach SHOULD be the intuitive subtraction because we expect the before image to have more light than the image after the power outage, but due to external factors when the satellite picked up these images, the after layer actually is the layer with more light. So we need to swap these variables, as we do in the next line of code. I want to think more abou this, because the result of this subtraction assigns a positive or negative value to each point, so we need to be sure that we are subtracting in the right order.

#check out some summary stats cause there's so many rows:

#Next, reclassify the difference raster. Assume that any location that experienced a drop of more than 200 nW cm-2 sr-1 is a location of a blackout.
# Hint: we can use binary predicates to do a reclassification.

# on the slack channel, Niklas confirmed that the layers are already rasters. The class() function returns "stars" which is in quotes, so I am not sure how to interpret that. summary() returns that it has no class...?

Our region of interest (ROI) is the metropolitan Houstan area. We define the ROI with a bounding box of:

-96.5, 29
-96.5, 30.5
-94.5, 30.5
-94.5, 29

```{r}
# given the ROI coordinates, make a polygon, repeating the last point to close out the polygon
roi_polygon <- st_polygon(list(rbind(c(-96.5, 29), c(-96.5, 30.5), c(-94.5, 30.5), c(-94.5, 29), c(-96.5, 29))))
```

```{r}
# convert the polygon to a simple feature
roi_sf <- st_sfc(roi_polygon)
class(roi_sf)
class(blackout_mask)
# check the CRS
st_crs(blackout_mask) 
# WGS 84

# assign same CRS
st_crs(roi_sf) <- 4326

# quick check
st_crs(roi_sf) 
# WGS 84 !!!

```

```{r}
# identify areas 200 m either side of all highways

highway_buffer <- st_buffer(highways, 200)

### Try to figure out the number of houses that lost power
